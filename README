# Description
  In this game, the player is presented with a grid of face-down cards. The objective is to find and match all pairs of cards by flipping two cards at a time. If a pair matches, the cards remain face-up; if not, they flip back after a short delay. Once all pairs are matched, the game is won.

# How to Play
  1. Start the Game: Click the "Start Game" or "Restart" button to begin a new game.
  2. Flip Cards: Click on any card to flip it over. A second click will flip another card.
  3. Match Cards: If the two flipped cards are a matching pair, they will remain face-up. If they do not match, they will flip back after a short delay.
  4. Win the Game: Once all pairs are matched, the game is won, and you can start a new game by clicking the restart button.

# Game Logic
  1. Shuffle Function: A shuffle function randomizes the positions of the cards at the start of the game.
  2. Card Flipping: When a card is clicked, it flips to reveal its face. Two cards are compared for a match, and if they match, they remain face-up. If they don't match, they flip back after a delay.
  3. State Management: The game tracks which cards are flipped, which pairs have been matched, and whether all pairs have been found.
  4. Restart Functionality: Clicking the restart button reshuffles the cards and resets the game state.

# Technologies Used
  HTML5: Structure of the game board.
  CSS3: Styling and layout for the responsive design.
